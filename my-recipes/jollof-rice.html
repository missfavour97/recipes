        <h2>Steps;</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Blend fresh tomatoes, red bell peppers, Scotch bonnet, and onions into a smooth mix. </li> 
            <li>Heat oil in a pot and fry the tomato paste for a few minutes, then add the blended mixture.</li>
            <li>Cook until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the stew.</li>
            <li>Add salt, curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, seasoning cubes, and a little black or white pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir well and let the sauce simmer for 5/10 minutes to deepen the flavor.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken or beef stock and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if necessaryâ€”this liquid will determine your rice flavor.</li>
            <li>Add washed parboiled rice to the sauce and stir thoroughly to coat the rice evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil or a tight lid to trap the steam and cook on low heat until the rice softens.</li>
            <li>When the rice is tender and the liquid absorbed, stir gently from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>Add a knob of butter for extra richness. Serve with fried plantain, chicken, or salad.</li>
        </ol>
